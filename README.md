# Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to the **Data Analysis** directory! This folder contains all my data analytics projects where I explore, clean, analyze, and visualize data to derive meaningful insights.

## Overview

Each project in this directory focuses on a specific dataset or problem, employing various data analysis techniques such as:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis
- Data visualization
- Predictive modeling (where applicable)

## Project Structure

Each project is organized in its own subfolder and typically includes:

- **Data:** Raw and/or processed datasets used in the project
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks or scripts documenting the analysis
- **Reports:** Summary reports or presentations (optional)
- **Visualizations:** Charts, graphs, and other visuals created during the analysis

## How to Use

1. Navigate into the project folder of interest.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook or script to follow along with the analysis.
3. Run the code cells to reproduce the results (ensure dependencies are installed).
4. Review the visualizations and summary reports for insights.

## Requirements

The projects generally require the following Python libraries (install via `pip install`):

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for predictive modeling projects)
- jupyter (for notebook viewing)

## Contribution

Feel free to explore and provide feedback. If you want to contribute new projects or improvements, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
